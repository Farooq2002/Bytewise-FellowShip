WIDGETS IN FLUTTER

Widgets in Flutter which are the building blocks for creating the UI of your app. The section you've specifically pointed out, "Stateful vs. Stateless Widgets", discusses the difference between two types of widgets in Flutter: stateful and stateless.

Stateless widgets: These are widgets that do not have any mutable state. They are immutable and their properties cannot change during the lifetime of the widget. When the widget needs to update its UI, it is simply rebuilt with new property values. Examples of stateless widgets include Text, Image, and Icon.

Stateful widgets: These are widgets that have mutable state. They maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget, such as user input or data from a network request. When the state of the widget changes, it triggers a rebuild of the widget tree to reflect the new state. Examples of stateful widgets include TextField, Checkbox, and Slider.
