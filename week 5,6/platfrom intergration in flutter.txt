Platform integration in Flutter




Platform integration refers to the process of integrating your Flutter app with platform-specific features or services that are not provided by Flutter itself. Here's a breakdown of the page:

Integrating with platform-specific APIs: This section covers how to use plugins to access native platform APIs (e.g. camera, location, sensors) from your Flutter app. Flutter provides a rich set of plugins that allow you to easily access these APIs and use them in your app.

Integrating with native views: Sometimes you may need to integrate native views into your Flutter app, such as a native map view or a video player. This section covers how to use platform views to embed native views into your Flutter app and interact with them from Flutter.

Integrating with background tasks: Flutter provides APIs to run background tasks on both Android and iOS, such as fetching data from a remote server or processing images. This section covers how to use these APIs to run tasks in the background and update your app's UI as needed.

Integrating with plugins: Plugins are packages that provide additional functionality to your Flutter app, such as access to Google Analytics or Facebook Login. This section covers how to use plugins in your app and how to create your own plugins to share functionality across multiple apps.

Integrating with platform channels: Platform channels provide a way for Flutter to communicate with platform-specific code running on the host platform (e.g. Android or iOS). This section covers how to use platform channels to communicate between Flutter and native platform code, such as accessing native APIs or passing data between the two.
